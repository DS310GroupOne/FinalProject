# FinalProject
As Caladan prepares for a potential surge in COVID-19 cases, Team 1 has been enlisted to assist in devising an effective mitigation plan. We guided our analysis with a key question: What are the least restrictive measures that can be taken to keep the growth rate of deaths below 1% and the growth rate of new cases below 3% based on a 30-day rolling average? Our strategy was to examine the effectiveness of policies from ten representative countries in managing the growth rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The goal of this research was to identify which policies have been the most successful and least restrictive in curbing the spread of the virus. This report aims to explore this analysis while delving into the nuances of effectiveness, timing, and external factors that may impact outcomes.
